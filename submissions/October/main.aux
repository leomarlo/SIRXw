In (a) we show three approximations of $r_\infty $ for the adaptive SIRX model via the Pair Approximation \textup  {\hbox {\mathsurround \z@ \normalfont  (\ignorespaces \ref  {eq:mfa}\unskip \@@italiccorr )}}, the implicit equation \textup  {\hbox {\mathsurround \z@ \normalfont  (\ignorespaces \ref  {eq:boundrinf}\unskip \@@italiccorr )}} and via repeated simulation of the stochastic dynamics. The implicit equation is an inequality in $r_\infty $ and depends on the initial conditions, which are here chosen in agreement with the other approximations, namely $\rho _I(0) = 0.01$ and $\rho _{SI}(0) = \mu \rho _I(0)$. The inequality is achieved by a H\"older bound, which requires a positivity condition on $\mathaccentV {dot}05F\rho _{SI}-2\mathaccentV {dot}05F\rho _{SS}\geq 0$ at all times. In (b) we show the shaded regions where the positivity condition holds for a range of infection rate $\beta =0.003$ (blue, upper set of lines), $\beta =0.0025$ (black, middle set of lines) and $\beta =0.002$ (red, lower set of lines). For each infection rate we show the boundary for a set of initial conditions to illustrate the dependence on $\rho _I(0)$ and $\rho _{SI}(0)$.
