## Codebase for the adaptive SIRX model

Please find in this repository the code for the adaptive SIRX model. 

- *PA.m* contains the pair approximation.
- *SIRW.m* contains the definition of the model.
- *run.m* contains the code that runs the simulations for the model and the Pair approximation a given number of times, which can be set.

Then there are some helper functions

- *InitState.m* initializes the state of the network.

The research paper with the results can be found here [https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.10516](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.10516).
